# Contributing Rules
1. At least, you must add something that will fix a minor bug, warning message, etc.
2. Please do not make spam pull requests that remove literally everything in the repo. These will not be merged, and will be rejected.
3. Please add credits to your pull request if anybody else helped you with it.
4. Please look for duplicate pull requests before creating one.

# I've submitted my pull request. What do I do?
Just wait, and I'll get around to it.

# Will I receive anything for a pull request?
Your name will be added to the Contributors section on GitHub, and if anybody else helped you with your PR, their name will be added to CONTRIBUTORS.md with the PR number.
